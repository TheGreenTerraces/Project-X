Changeable Crosshair in options menu

HOW:
----
By using this code (below) you can load images (or whatever) directly from the assets. 

You have to put the asset in a folder called "Resources". Then it's a matter of using Resources.Load.

myTexture = Resources.Load("Images/myImage") as Texture2D;

Add a way to change between many kinds of crosshair in the options menu.


PRIORITY: lowest
